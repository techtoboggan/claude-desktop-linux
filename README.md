# Claude Desktop for Linux

Builds and installs Claude Desktop on Linux from the official Windows release, with full support for:

- **Cowork / Local Agent Mode** — runs Claude Code CLI directly (no VM required)
- **MCP** — `~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Ctrl+Alt+Space** popup
- **System tray** (tray icons auto-inverted to white for dark Linux trays)
- **Wayland** — native Wayland via `--ozone-platform-hint=auto`
- **Bundled Claude Code CLI** — `claude` command available after install

## Requirements

- RPM-based distro: Fedora, RHEL, CentOS, Rocky Linux, AlmaLinux
- Node.js >= 18.0.0 and npm
- Root/sudo access

## Installation

```bash
# Install build deps
sudo dnf install rpm-build

# Clone and build
git clone https://github.com/techtoboggan/claude-desktop-linux.git
cd claude-desktop-linux
sudo ./build.sh

# Install the RPM
sudo dnf install build/electron-app/$(uname -m)/claude-desktop-*.rpm
```

### Electron binary

The installed Claude Desktop uses your system Electron. If you hit GTK conflicts, install a standalone Electron:

```bash
cd /tmp
wget https://github.com/electron/electron/releases/download/v37.0.0/electron-v37.0.0-linux-x64.zip
sudo unzip electron-v37.0.0-linux-x64.zip -d /opt/electron
sudo chmod +x /opt/electron/electron

# Patch the launcher to use it
sudo tee /usr/bin/claude-desktop << 'EOF'
#!/bin/bash
LOG_FILE="$HOME/claude-desktop-launcher.log"
/opt/electron/electron /usr/lib64/claude-desktop/app.asar \
  --ozone-platform-hint=auto \
  --enable-logging=file --log-file=$LOG_FILE --log-level=INFO \
  --disable-gpu-sandbox --no-sandbox "$@"
EOF
sudo chmod +x /usr/bin/claude-desktop
```

## Version pinning

The `CLAUDE_VERSION` file pins the exact Claude release. To update:

1. Edit line 1 of `CLAUDE_VERSION` with the new version string
2. Optionally add the SHA256 of the nupkg on line 2 for verification
3. Commit and rebuild

---

## How it works

Claude Desktop ships as a Windows `.exe` installer containing an Electron app in an `.asar` archive. The build script:

1. Downloads the nupkg directly (or the Windows installer for unpinned builds)
2. Extracts the app and replaces platform-specific native modules with Linux stubs
3. Patches the app for Linux window decorations (CSD) and tray icons
4. Enables Cowork by patching the platform-gating code in the minified JS
5. Injects startup code for menu bar removal and window icon
6. Bundles the Claude Code CLI
7. Repackages everything as an RPM

### Cowork on Linux

Instead of running a VM (as on macOS/Windows), Cowork on Linux spawns the Claude Code CLI directly with optional [bubblewrap](https://github.com/containers/bubblewrap) sandboxing. The stubs in `stubs/` implement the full IPC interface the app expects.

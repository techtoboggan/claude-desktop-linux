# Claude Desktop for Linux (Hardened)

A security-focused Linux build of Claude Desktop. Downloads the official release, applies bubblewrap sandboxing, credential redaction, and permission-gated Computer Use — then packages it for Fedora, Debian/Ubuntu, and Arch Linux.

## Features

- **Cowork / Local Agent Mode** — sandboxed via [bubblewrap](https://github.com/containers/bubblewrap) with default-deny filesystem, resource limits, credential redaction, and environment allowlisting
- **Computer Use** — screenshot, click, type, and scroll automation for both X11 and Wayland, gated by a per-session permission dialog (no auto-grant)
- **MCP** (Model Context Protocol) — configure servers in `~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Ctrl+Alt+Space** quick entry popup
- **System tray** with auto-inverted icons for dark themes
- **Native Wayland support** — auto-detected, with proper taskbar pinning, window grouping, and Ozone platform hints
- **Bundled Claude Code CLI** — `claude` command available system-wide after install
- **Diagnostic tool** — `claude-desktop-hardened --doctor` checks your system for missing dependencies and misconfigurations

## Post-install

### Verify your setup

```bash
claude-desktop-hardened --doctor
```

Checks Electron, chrome-sandbox permissions, bubblewrap, display server, Computer Use tools, MCP config, Claude Code CLI, Node.js, and keyring availability.

### Computer Use tools (optional)

Install the tools for your display server to enable Computer Use:

**Wayland** (GNOME, KDE Plasma, Sway, Hyprland):
```bash
# Fedora
sudo dnf install grim slurp wl-clipboard ydotool wlr-randr

# Debian / Ubuntu
sudo apt install grim slurp wl-clipboard ydotool wlr-randr

# Arch
sudo pacman -S grim slurp wl-clipboard ydotool wlr-randr
```

**X11**:
```bash
# Fedora
sudo dnf install wmctrl xdotool scrot xclip xrandr

# Debian / Ubuntu
sudo apt install wmctrl xdotool scrot xclip x11-xserver-utils

# Arch
sudo pacman -S wmctrl xdotool scrot xclip xorg-xrandr
```

### Keyboard shortcuts on Wayland

Wayland does not allow applications to register global keyboard shortcuts (like Ctrl+Alt+Space) — this is a security feature of the protocol. The launcher enables the `GlobalShortcutsPortal` Electron feature flag, which works on **KDE Plasma** and **Hyprland** (users assign the key in system settings).

For compositors without portal support (GNOME, Sway), bind a shortcut manually:

```bash
# Hyprland (~/.config/hypr/hyprland.conf)
bind = CTRL ALT, Space, exec, claude-desktop-hardened --focus

# Sway (~/.config/sway/config)
bindsym Ctrl+Alt+Space exec claude-desktop-hardened --focus

# i3 (~/.config/i3/config)
bindsym Ctrl+Alt+space exec claude-desktop-hardened --focus
```

Run `claude-desktop-hardened --doctor` to check if your compositor supports the GlobalShortcuts portal.

### MCP servers

Configure MCP servers in `~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "example": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/server.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Security model

This project treats Claude's agentic capabilities as a security boundary. Every feature that touches the host system is sandboxed, logged, or gated behind user confirmation.

### Cowork sandboxing

When Cowork spawns a Claude Code session, it runs inside a [bubblewrap](https://github.com/containers/bubblewrap) sandbox with a default-deny filesystem policy:

- **Minimal rootfs** — only `/usr`, `/lib`, `/lib64`, and select `/etc` files are mounted read-only. The agent cannot see your home directory, browser data, password managers, or other users' files.
- **Writable mounts** limited to the working directory, session data, and `~/.config/Claude`
- **Resource limits** via `systemd-run` — 4GB memory, 200% CPU (2 cores), 512 max tasks to prevent runaway processes and fork bombs
- **`--die-with-parent`** ensures cleanup if the parent process exits
- **Environment allowlisting** — only safe variables pass through (HOME, PATH, DISPLAY, XDG_*, etc.)
- **No unsandboxed fallback** — if bubblewrap is not found, sessions refuse to start

Bubblewrap is a **hard dependency** — if you're using this package, you get sandboxing. That's the point.

### Network access

Sandboxed sessions have **full network access**. Claude Code needs HTTPS to `api.anthropic.com` to function, and isolating the network would break core functionality. This means the agent can theoretically reach internal services on your network. If you run services on localhost or your LAN that accept unauthenticated requests, be aware of this. We may add network policy support (via nftables or a proxy) in a future release.

### Computer Use permissions

Every Computer Use permission request shows a native dialog — nothing is auto-granted:

- **Screen Recording** — screenshot capture via `grim` (Wayland) or `scrot` (X11)
- **Input Automation** — click/type/scroll via `ydotool` (Wayland) or `xdotool` (X11)
- **Window Listing** — via `hyprctl`/`swaymsg` (Wayland) or `wmctrl` (X11)

Grants are session-only — they reset when you close Claude Desktop. All Computer Use actions are logged to the transcript store with credential redaction applied.

### Credential redaction

All session transcripts are scrubbed before hitting disk:

- Bearer tokens, API keys (AWS, GitHub, Anthropic, OpenAI, Slack, Stripe, npm, PyPI)
- JWTs, OAuth tokens, private keys, database connection strings
- Google Cloud service account key IDs
- Generic secrets in environment-style assignments
- Sensitive environment variables filtered from subprocess environments

### Path safety

File operations are checked against a blocklist that includes sensitive directories (`.ssh`, `.gnupg`, `.aws`, `.kube`, `.docker`) and persistence vectors (`.bashrc`, `.profile`, `.config/autostart`, `cron`). Path traversal (`..`) is blocked at the raw input level before normalization.

### Electron sandbox

The `chrome-sandbox` binary is set to `4755 root:root` (setuid) during post-install. This preserves Electron's multi-process sandbox — the renderer runs in a restricted namespace even if the main process is compromised.

---

## Supply chain integrity

### Version pinning

Two files control all external dependency versions:

- **`CLAUDE_VERSION`** — pins the exact Claude Desktop release (version + SHA256 of the nupkg)
- **`TOOL_VERSIONS`** — pins Electron, asar, cdxgen, Claude CLI, vet, and container image digests

All GitHub Actions are pinned to full commit SHAs. Container images are pinned to SHA256 digests. npm packages are installed with `--ignore-scripts`.

### CI pipeline

Every push and PR runs:

- **Unit tests** — credential classifier (19 tests), path safety (9 tests), patch system (19 tests), doctor integration (7 tests)
- **Package smoke tests** — verifies each built package contains expected files, correct permissions, valid desktop entry, and reasonable size
- **Source integrity** — trojan source / Unicode attack scanning on all JS, shell, and Python files
- **Dependency scanning** — OWASP depscan for vulnerabilities, vet for malware
- **Post-patch validation** — `node --check` verifies patched JS is syntactically valid
- **SBOM** — CycloneDX bill of materials attached to every release

### Automated updates

A CI workflow checks for new Claude Desktop releases daily. When a new version is found, it:

1. Downloads the new nupkg and computes its SHA256
2. Test-builds an RPM in a Fedora container to verify patches apply cleanly
3. Validates the patched JS with `node --check`
4. If everything passes, pushes the version bump to `main` (which triggers the release pipeline)
5. If the build fails, opens a GitHub issue with diagnostics and the build log

### Release pipeline

When `CLAUDE_VERSION` changes on `main`, the release workflow:

1. Builds RPM, DEB, and Arch packages in pinned containers
2. Generates a CycloneDX SBOM
3. Creates a GitHub Release with SHA256SUMS (GPG-signed if key is configured)
4. Publishes to Fedora COPR, GitHub Pages APT repo, and AUR automatically

---

## How it works

Claude Desktop ships as a Windows `.exe` installer containing an Electron app. The build script:

1. **Downloads** the pinned nupkg (version + SHA256 verified from `CLAUDE_VERSION`)
2. **Extracts icons** from the Windows exe (16px through 256px)
3. **Replaces native modules** — swaps Windows/macOS native addons with Linux stubs for keyboard constants, platform detection, and Cowork session management
4. **Installs Cowork stubs** — a process orchestrator for spawning sandboxed Claude Code CLI sessions with credential redaction, file watching, session persistence, and IPC handling
5. **Installs Computer Use modules** — display-server-aware screenshot, window listing, and input automation with a permission dialog layer
6. **Patches platform gating** — modular patches in `patches/` surgically modify 8 locations in the minified JS to accept Linux as a supported platform
7. **Patches window decorations** — switches from macOS `hiddenInset` to Electron CSD with transparent title bar overlay
8. **Injects startup code** — sets the window icon, fixes the system tray, sets Wayland `app_id`, and registers permission-gated Computer Use handlers
9. **Inverts tray icons** for dark Linux system trays
10. **Bundles Claude Code CLI** from npm (pinned version, `--ignore-scripts`)
11. **Packages** as RPM, DEB, or Arch with post-install hooks for icon caches, desktop database updates, and chrome-sandbox setuid

### Patch architecture

Platform patches are modular — each lives in its own file under `patches/`:

| Patch | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `patch_platform_gating.py` | Accept Linux in platform check functions |
| `patch_vm_manifest.py` | Add Linux entries to VM image manifest |
| `patch_platform_constants.py` | Include Linux in `isSupportedPlatform` |
| `patch_enterprise_config.py` | Ensure VM features aren't forced off |
| `patch_api_headers.py` | Spoof platform headers for feature checks |
| `patch_binary_manager.py` | Add Linux to `getHostPlatform()` |
| `patch_binary_resolution.py` | Find system-installed Claude CLI |
| `inject_cowork_init.py` | Wire up Cowork lifecycle hooks |

This makes version bumps easier — when upstream renames minified symbols, you update one file instead of a monolithic script.

### Package metadata

All packaging specs (RPM, DEB, Arch, COPR repackage) are generated from a single source of truth:

```bash
python3 packaging/generate-specs.py
```

This reads `packaging/metadata.json` and outputs all four spec files, ensuring dependencies, file lists, and descriptions never drift.
